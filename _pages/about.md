I am currently Associate Researcher at Chinese Academy of Military Science in Beijing. 

I recieved my Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering from the College of Systems Engineeringthe at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), as advised by Prof. Lining Xing, awarded in December 2020. From September 2017 to October 2019, I was a Visiting Researcher at KU Leuven Mobility Research Center - CIB, Belgium, working with Prof. Pieter Vansteewegen. Prior to my Ph.D., I hold a Master’s degree in Management Science and Engineering, specializing in robustness optimization of complex networks and a Bachelor’s degree in Management Engineering at NUDT.

My doctoral research focused on developing heuristics and exact algorithms for Agile Earth Observation Satellite scheduling, with strong theoretical ties to the Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW). Specifically, I investigated novel variants of OPTW incorporating time-dependent travel times and time-dependent rewards, addressing complex dynamic constraints inherent in real-world satellite mission planning.

I am currently serving as a reviewer for the journals in operations research, such as Computers & Operations Research (COR), Computers \& Industrial Engineering (CIE), and in space technique field, such as Advances in Space Research.
